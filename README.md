## Introduction

The Cash Engine Simulation Project is an interactive web application designed to simulate the behavior of RAM-cash interaction in a computer architecture. This project provides insights into memory addressing, cache organization, and related concepts.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `css/`: Contains the Cascading Style Sheets for styling the application.
- `js/`: Contains JavaScript files for different functionalities.
- `src/`: Contains the HTML files used to display different sections of the application.

## Getting Started

To run the simulation locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using:

    git clone https://github.com/your-username/cash-engine.git

2. Open the project directory:

    cd cash-engine

3. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to launch the application.

## Usage

The Cash Engine Simulation provides the following features:

- Visualization of memory addressing and cache organization.
- Calculation of cache and RAM sizes based on user-defined parameters.
- Interactive settings to configure cache properties.

## Configuration

To configure the simulation parameters, follow these steps:

1. Open the simulation by launching the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Click on the "SETTINGS" button in the top menu to access the configuration modal.
3. Modify the following parameters:
- Cache Size (in bytes)
- RAM Address Length (in bits)
- Block Size (in bytes)
- Number of Cache Sets (N-way set associative)
- Cache Type (Separated or United)
- Reallocation Policy (Write Back or Write Through)
- Write Policy (FIFO, LRU, LFU, RANDOM)

## Technologies Used
